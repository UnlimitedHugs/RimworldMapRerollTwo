&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
Allows to randomize your starting maps and geyser locations until you find something you like.
Every reroll has a cost- in the form of unmined resources from your map.

This is the beta version of the mod. Please report any issues in the forum thread.

&lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
1) Start a new game or settle on a new map.
2) Find and claim the Dice of Fate monument.
3) With the monument selected, click on "Reroll map" or "Reroll geysers".

Once you mine your first piece of ore, the monument will deactivate, and rerolling will become unavailable on that map.

The resource cost is optional, and can be disabled in the Options &gt; Mod Settings menu.
